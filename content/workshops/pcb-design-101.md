# FPGA Development Fundamentals

Dive into the world of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and learn how to design digital circuits using Verilog HDL.

## Workshop Overview

This intermediate workshop covers the basics of FPGA development, from understanding the hardware to writing your first Verilog modules.

## Topics Covered

### 1. FPGA Architecture (45 minutes)

- What are FPGAs and how do they work?
- Comparison with microcontrollers and processors
- FPGA development workflow

### 2. Verilog Basics (60 minutes)

- HDL vs traditional programming
- Modules, ports, and signals
- Combinational and sequential logic

### 3. Hands-on Development (75 minutes)

- Setting up Vivado project
- Writing and simulating Verilog code
- Synthesis and implementation
- Programming the FPGA

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of digital logic
- Familiarity with binary and hexadecimal number systems
- Some programming experience (any language)

## What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have created a simple counter circuit that displays on LEDs and responds to button presses.
